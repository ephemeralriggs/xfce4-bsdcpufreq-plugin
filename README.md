xfce4-bsdcpufreq-plugin
=======================

CPU frequency monitor applet for BSD operating systems

The approach is minimalistic. No autotools, no configure
script, no black magic. Just plain Makefiles and the code.

So far, development and testing has been done on FreeBSD.
I am happy to include patches to make it work on other
BSD systems.
